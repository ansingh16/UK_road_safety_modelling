# ðŸš¦ UK Road Accident Severity Prediction & Hotspot Mapping (2023)

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project uses the **UK Department for Transport Road Safety Data (2023)** to:
- **Predict accident severity** (Fatal, Serious, Slight) using machine learning
- **Identify accident hotspots** via geospatial analysis
- Explore the impact of weather, road conditions, time of day, and vehicle types on road safety

The dataset contains detailed records of road traffic accidents across the UK, including:
- Collision details (time, location, weather, road type, speed limit, lighting)
- Vehicles involved (type, manoeuvre, movement, load)
- Casualties (age, gender, role, severity)

By combining these datasets, we build predictive models and interactive maps to support **data-driven road safety improvements**.
